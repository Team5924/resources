# cots

good designs effectively balance the use of cots and custom compenents

## common cots components

### [versaframe](https://www.vexrobotics.com/vexpro/versaframe)

the versaframe product line contains parts for numerous different kinds of mechanism. the heart of the versaframe product line is the versaframe tubing which is predrilled 2"x1" or 1"x1" aluminum tubing in either 0.04" or 0.1" wall thickness. the 0.5" predrilled pattern is what makes the versaframe product so special. the holes are perfect for a 5/32" rivet or an 8-32 screw. versaframe gussets allow versaframe to be connected in a variety of ways easily. vex also provides parts to easily make [custom drivetrains](https://www.vexrobotics.com/versachassis.html) and [linear motion systems](https://www.vexrobotics.com/linear-motion.html).

the predrilled hole pattern and accompanying products remove the need for precision bearing bores and other precision machining so that robust and competitive mechanisms can be made with a simple drill and hacksaw.

the versaplanetary product line allows a planetary gearbox of a custom ratio to be made and interfaced with the common frc motors easily. 

### drive gearboxes

andymark, vexpro, and wcp all sell different drivetrain gearboxes. these gearboxes vary in areas such as amount of motors, single/double speed, shifting type (dog or ball), and reduction.

### [thunderhex](https://www.vexrobotics.com/thunderhexstock.html)

thunderhex is rounded 7075 T6 aluminum hex stock made and sold by vexpro. thunderhex is compatible with 1/2" hex and thunderhex bearings. it's anodized black for superior performance.

the president of vex explains the thunderhex bearing [here](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?t=131631).

thunderhex can be made with regular hex stock and a lathe

if thunderhex isn't fitting smoothly into thunderhex bearings, the round edges can be sanded down until bearing shaft interface is smooth
