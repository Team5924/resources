# drivetrain design

everything else the robot does is built on the drivetrain, so it's important to have a good foundation

## considerations

### speed

your robot should be fast enough that your cycle times aren't too limited but slow enough to be controllable and not trip breakers constantly

### motors

usually drivetrains use cim motors because they're powerful and can be stalled for relatively long periods of time. however, 

775pros aren't a good idea for drivetrain motors unless you know what you're doing

### drop center

a drop center helps with maneuverability. it allows a robot with six wheels to drive like a robot with four.

### chain vs belts

belts are wider than chain. chain doesn't need to be purchased in a fixed loop which can make maintenance and iteration easier. chain is usually heavier. 

rough games like stronghold may warrant a larger safety margin. stepping up to #35 from #25 is a good precaution

### wheels

wheel diameter should be accounted for in gearbox and speed calculations in order to calculate surface speed 

### ground clearance

in games like stronghold, ground clearance is important to avoid unnecessary robot damge from interacting with field elements

### live vs dead axle

live axle is nice in designs like the west coast drive. it allows the wheel to be placed closer to the frame which reduces the cantilever on the drive shafts. live axle works well with wheels that have a built in hex bore (like the colson performa wheels sold by vex)
