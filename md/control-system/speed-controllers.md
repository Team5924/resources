# speed controllers

frc speed controllers communicate via can or pwm

## models

for most applications, the speed controller you use won't make a big difference as long as you choose a reliable one. the talon srx, victor sp, and spark have all been reliable in our experience.

### talon srx

* made by vex
* has smart features
* built in wires
* can or pwm control
