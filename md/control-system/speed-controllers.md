frc speed controllers communicate via can or pwm

## models

for most applications, the speed controller you use won't make a big difference as long as you choose a reliable one. the talon srx, victor sp, and spark have all been reliable in our experience.

### talon srx

* can or pwm control

### [victor sp](https://www.vexrobotics.com/217-9090.html)
