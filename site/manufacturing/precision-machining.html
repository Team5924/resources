<h1>precision machining</h1>
<h2>machines</h2>
<p>The mill and lathe are manual machines that allow us to create very precise parts. A manual machine is generally preferable to a cnc when a few or a single copy of a design is needed.</p>
<p>The CNC is also a precision machine, but it is computer controlled. See the cnc page for more info.</p>
<h2>tools</h2>
<h3>reamer</h3>
<p>a reamer is used for making very precise holes. we usually use a reamer for making pressfits.</p>
<h3>twist drill</h3>
<p>a twist drill is the type of drill bit that is commonly used in hand drills.</p>
<h3>drill chuck</h3>
<p>the drill chuck is used to hold drill bits</p>
<h3>end mill</h3>
<p>end mills are used in the mill for most operations. they can face, bore, and do many more operations.</p>
<h3>parting tool</h3>
<p>see parting operation</p>
<h3>parallels</h3>
<p>parallels are metal blocks with precisely ground surfaces. they keep work clamped in a vise parallel and raised</p>
<h3>vise</h3>
<p>the work is clamped in a vise or multiple vises. usually a long tube will be clamped with two or more vises.</p>
<p>the vise contains known reference surfaces, such as the fixed jaw.</p>
<h3>indicator</h3>
<p>an indicator is a precise measuring tool</p>
<h2>opeations</h2>
<h3>facing</h3>
<p>cutting a face onto the work</p>
<h3>drilling</h3>
<p>drilling a hole</p>
<h3>parting</h3>
<p>parting is done on a lathe with a parting tool. parting is the act of cutting a piece of the work at a specific length</p>
