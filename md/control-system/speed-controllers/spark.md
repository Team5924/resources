## power input

minimum of 12awg wire is to be used. crimp #6 or #8 yellow ring terminals onto wire and screw onto spark.

**warning:** polarity is important on the input. sparks don't have reverse polarity protection

## motor output

minimum of 12awg wire is to be used. crimp #6 or #8 yellow ring terminals onto wire and screw onto spark.

reversed polarity isn't harmful on the output (nay harm mechanism motor is connected to). it will simply reverse the motor's direction.

## connecting to the roborio

the spark uses pwm as its interface between it and its controller

## mode

brake and coast mode can be toggled using the mode button

## limit switch input

the spark has limit switch input which will cut power in a direction without any software or roborio intervention. just plug a switch into the appropriate limit switch input.
