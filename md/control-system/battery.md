# battery

frc robots use 12v SLA (sealed lead acid) batteries

## description

* ~14lbs
* ~17 amp hours

## legal batteries

first has traditionally allowed different batteries with similar properties 

## safety

the sla batteries used in frc are safe when handled properly

## battery beak

the battery beak is a product from ctre that load tests batteries. it measures properties such as internal resistance and state of charge.

see the [product page](https://www.ctr-electronics.com/battery-beak.html#product_tabs_technical_resources) and [user manual](http://www.ctr-electronics.com/downloads/pdf/Beak-User-Manual.pdf)

## connector

the frc batteries use the anderson sb50 connector with at least 6awg wire (max size for sb50) to connect to the robot
1) 

## best practices

* use a new battery every match
* use a battery beak to check batteries
* keep wires from battery terminals to connector short as possible
* use lock nuts to secure lugs to the battery terminals to prevent them from loosening which can increase resistance
* cover exposed terminals. tape and heatshrink are convenient
