## using weidmullers

steps for using weidmullers without ferrules

* strip wire
* twist stripped wire
* hold down white button
* insert wire fully
* release connector
* tug test - if it comes loose, redo

the weidmuller connectors used in the frc control system have a max of 16awg

### good practices

* make sure there is no exposed wire. exposed wire can lead to strain or shorts
* ensure the wire doesn't have frayed strands that can short against other wires
* use ferrules
