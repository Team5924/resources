<h1>chain</h1>
<p>roller chain is an effective way to transmit torque</p>
<p><img src="http://edwinsanimatedimages.com/Gifs/chain.gif" alt=""></p>
<h2>#25 vs #35</h2>
<p>these are the two most common sizes of chain used in frc</p>
<p>most frc application are fine with #25. rough games (such as stronghold) may warrant #35 in the drivetrain. #25 is generally preferable as it is lighter and is compatible with the darksoul chain tool. however, #35 is more forgiving with misalignment</p>
<h2>darksoul chain tool</h2>
<p>the darksoul chain tool is a tool to break and make chain. this tool is preferred for its speed and not using master links.</p>
<p>the darksoul works by pushing a link's rivet out to allow its connecting link to be removed. with the chain at its desired length, the ends links are held together and the rivet is pushed back in to make the loop.</p>

<h2>center distance</h2>
<p>since chain can't be made into arbitray lengths, center to center distances are important. a special calculator can be used to get the calculated center distance given sprocket teeth, chain pitch, and number of links</p>
<p>some people like to add a fudge factor to the calculated center distance to take up manufacturing tolerances</p>
